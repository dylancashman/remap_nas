The quickdraw dataset must be downloaded here.  It was not included in the repository because it is too large for the repo, but it is freely available via the `googlecreativelab` github repo.

[https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset/blob/master/README.md#numpy-bitmaps-npy](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset/blob/master/README.md#numpy-bitmaps-npy)

There is no programmatic API to download it, so we cannot include a script, but if you download the following `.npy` files into this directory, the rest of the application should work.

    full_numpy_bitmap_apple.npy
    full_numpy_bitmap_face.npy
    full_numpy_bitmap_moustache.npy
    full_numpy_bitmap_mouth.npy
    full_numpy_bitmap_nose.npy
    full_numpy_bitmap_octopus.npy
    full_numpy_bitmap_pear.npy
    full_numpy_bitmap_pineapple.npy
    full_numpy_bitmap_umbrella.npy
